A simple trivia based game with questions about programming. A school project for SPŠE Ječná.

***Trivia questions are written in Czech. If you can't speak Czech, this game will be very difficult!***

### Controls:
WASD or arrows for moving, mouse for pressing buttons and options.

### How to win:
The goal is to reach babicka's house (upper right corner) with at least three gifts. Karkulka starts with two gifts in her inventory. There are several fields on the map:
- **KARKULKA'S HOME** = the starting position. Doesn't do anything.
- **FOREST PATH** = a simple forst path. Doesn't do anything.
- **MUSHROOM FIELD** = Karkulka can collect mushrooms and add one gift to her inventory.
- **BLUDNY KOREN** = this field transfers Karkulka to a random place on the game map. This can mean immediate victory or immediate death.
- **OBSTACLE (ROCK)** = this field gives Karkulka a trivia question. If answered correctly, Karkulka can move on. If answered incorrectly, Karkulka can get help from Myslivec in exchange for one inventory item.
- **BABICKA'S HOME** = reach this field with at least three items to win.

### The Wolf:
Avoid The Wolf at all costs. If it catches Karkulka, she dies immediately.

***Good luck!***
